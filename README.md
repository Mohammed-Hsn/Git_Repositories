## Operating Systems Concepts - Code Implementation (C)

This repository contains C code implementations for various concepts related to operating systems. It serves as a learning resource to explore and understand the functionality of these concepts through practical examples.

### Implemented Concepts:

* **Banker's Algorithm:** Code simulating the banker's algorithm for deadlock detection and avoidance in resource allocation.
* **System Calls:** Examples of system call implementations demonstrating interaction between user programs and the operating system.
* **Disk Scheduling:** Implementations of disk scheduling algorithms like FCFS (First Come First Served), SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), SCAN, and C-LOOK to optimize disk access times.
* **CPU Scheduling:** Code for CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF (Shortest Job First), Priority scheduling, and Round Robin to manage CPU allocation amongst processes.
* **Page Replacement Algorithms:** Implementations of page replacement algorithms like FIFO (First In First Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal for managing virtual memory.
* **Classical Synchronization Problems:** Code solutions for classical synchronization problems like the critical section problem, the producer-consumer problem, the reader-writer problem, etc.
* **Thread Concepts:** Examples of thread creation, synchronization, and communication to illustrate the concept of concurrency (**Note:** Threading capabilities may require additional libraries depending on your compiler).

### Prerequisites:

* C programming language
* Basic understanding of operating systems concepts
* A C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Running the Code:

Each folder within the repository corresponds to a specific concept. Refer to the individual folders' READMEs (if provided) for specific build and run instructions. Generally, you'll need to compile the code using your C compiler and then execute the resulting executable file. 

For example, assuming a file named `fcfs.c` implements the FCFS algorithm:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing `fcfs.c`.
2. Compile the code using a command like `gcc fcfs.c -o fcfs` (this creates an executable named `fcfs`).
3. Execute the program by typing `./fcfs` (assuming you're in the same directory).

### Contributing:

Feel free to contribute by adding new implementations, improving existing code, or fixing bugs. Please create a pull request with your changes and a clear description of what you've added or modified.
